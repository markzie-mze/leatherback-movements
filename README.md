# Leatherback turtle movements in the Solomon Islands 

##IN PROGRESS

##A TNC Melanesia Project

Research and management of the leatherback turtle is one of The Nature Conservancy Melanesia Programme's flagship marine conservation projects in the Solomon Islands in the south-western Pacific.

The project here comprises several parts including: 


### Long distance movements 
Maps depicting tracked individuals in the Pacific. 
See Moving Pandas for detail on developing these movement paths


### Local breeding area ranging behaviour
Kernel density analyses of "home range" areas around nesting beaches
- list steps
- generate python code to repeat steps for individuals
- 


### Animated dive profile 
Graphic showing dive profiles of individuals. Idea is to show an animation of turtles 3D use of space. Draw track in relation to surface and a DEM model of seafloor

- nb references re kernel, movement and dive profile analyses
