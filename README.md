# Leatherback turtle movements in the Solomon Islands 

## The Nature Conservancy Melanesia Project

Research and management of the leatherback turtle is one of The Nature Conservancy Melanesia Programme's flagship marine conservation projects in the Solomon Islands in the south-western Pacific.


The project here comprises several parts including: 

### Long distance movements 
Maps depicting tracked individuals in the Pacific. 


### Local breeding area ranging behaviour
Kernel density analyses of "home range" areas around nesting beaches


### Animated dive profile 
Graphic showing dive profiles of individuals. Idea is to show an animation of turtles 3D use of space. Draw track in relation to surface and a DEM model of seafloor
